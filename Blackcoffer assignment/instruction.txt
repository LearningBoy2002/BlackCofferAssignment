1.	explaining how you approached the solution

The solution to the assignment problem was to follow the the objectives which was to first extract the titles and the text with it.
it was easily done with beautifulsoup as only the article title (from the <h1> tag) and the main text (from <p> tags) was needed.
each of the extracted text and title was stored in individual files  named according to the URL_ID . This is done in a dedicated directory called TitleText for easy management.


The second part of the task required performing textual analysis on the extracted text files. The script loads stopwords using NLTK and augments them with additional stopwords from files located in a StopWords directory.
It also loads positive and negative words from text files in a MasterDictionary directory. These words are used to calculate sentiment scores.
By following the instructions in the "Text Analysis.docx" file all the metrics was created in functions analyze_sentiment and analyze_readability.


Finally, the results from the sentiment and readability analysis were merged with the original input data. 
The computed metrics were stored in a list of dictionaries, each corresponding to a URL_ID. 
The original DataFrame (df) was then merged with these results based on URL_ID. 
The data, including the original input variables and the newly computed analysis variables, was saved as a CSV file named Output_Data.csv, 
following the structure specified in Output Data Structure.xlsx.

2.	How to run the .py file to generate output

To run the Assignment.py file to generate output first you will need to install all the dependencies mentioned 
below and will have to keep the necessary files in the same such as input.xlsx, and folders StopWords and MasterDictionary 
in the same folder as the python file.
then if you using any code editor simply click the run button or just open a command promt in the same directory as the files 
and run the command "python Assignment.py".
